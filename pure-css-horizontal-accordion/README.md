# Pure CSS Horizontal Accordion

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/rrenula/pen/nZNwxw](https://codepen.io/rrenula/pen/nZNwxw).

Inspired by Ch3mical.com.

I saw this accordion at Paul Kelley's website. He had used jQuery and images to achieve the effect. I decided to take a CSS3 approach and use elements instead of images. I have use Genericons font for the social networking icons.
